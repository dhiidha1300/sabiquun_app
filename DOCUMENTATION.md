## Documentation Principles

1. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** - Link to content, don't duplicate
2. **Single Source of Truth** - Each concept lives in one place
3. **Progressive Disclosure** - Overview in README, details in dedicated docs
4. **Navigation First** - Always provide way back to README
5. **Examples Included** - Show, don't just tell
