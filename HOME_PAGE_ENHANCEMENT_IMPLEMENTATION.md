## 🔌 Integration Points

### **Routes Added**
- `/excuses` → ExcusesPlaceholderPage
- `/user-management` → UserManagementPlaceholderPage

- LoadTodayDeedsRequested(userId)
- LoadRecentReportsRequested(userId, limit: 5)
- LoadMonthlyStatsRequested(userId, month, year)

// PenaltyBloc
- LoadPenaltyBalanceRequested(userId)      ✅ Likely exists
- LoadRecentPenaltiesRequested(userId, limit: 5)

// PaymentBloc
- LoadPendingPaymentsRequested(userId)     ✅ Likely exists
- LoadRecentPaymentsRequested(userId, limit: 5)

// NotificationBloc (future)
- LoadUnreadNotificationsRequested(userId)
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### **Option 1: Test Enhanced Home Page Separately**
Navigate to `/enhanced-home` in the app to see all new features.

### **Option 2: Replace Original Home Page**
Edit `app_router.dart` line 102:
```dart
// Before
builder: (context, state) => const HomePage(),

// After
builder: (context, state) => const EnhancedHomePage(),
```

---

## 🔄 Data Flow (Mocked for Now)

Currently, all data is mocked with placeholder values:

```dart
// Mock Data Examples
final todayDeedsCompleted = 0;
final penaltyBalance = 125000.0;
final completionStreak = 0;
final activities = <ActivityItem>[];
```

### **To Connect Real Data:**
1. Add BLoC events to `initState()` of `EnhancedHomePage`
2. Wrap widgets in `BlocBuilder` or `BlocConsumer`
3. Pass real data to widget constructors
4. Handle loading/error states
